# Getting Started with the Computer Vision Service Base

*Published: April 23, 2025*

This is a walk you through setting up this Golang computer vision service based project. This service is designed to run as a Windows service, providing computer vision capabilities for identifying lines of people and vehicles in order processing scenarios, among any number of other feature requests and endless scope creep to our heart's content! Let's dive in and get this thing set up!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you've got these tools installed:

- Go 1.23 or later (we're using the latest and greatest!)
- Datadog Agent (for metrics and logging)

Requisites of note.

- You can use a Mac OS or Linux based system, as the build server will do the final build to Windows/Windows Server. All testing & development can be done on any of the platforms, and arguablly ought to be done on Mac OS or Linux.

## Project Structure

Let's take a quick look at what we've built:

```
golang-services-build-base/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go              # Main service entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ config/              # Configuration management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.go        # Configuration structs and loading
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod               # Go module definition
â””â”€â”€ go.sum               # Dependency checksums
```

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Initialize the Go Module

First things first, we need to set up our Go module. I like to use a GitHub-style module path, even if it's not going to be published immediately:

```bash
go mod init github.com/adron/golang-services-build-base
```

### 2. Add Dependencies

We're using some solid libraries for this project:

- `github.com/DataDog/datadog-go/v5` - For metrics and logging
- `github.com/gorilla/mux` - For HTTP routing
- `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` - For structured logging
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - For CLI interface

Run this to get everything downloaded:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Build the Service

Let's build our service:

```bash
go build -o vision-service
```

## Running the Service

You've got two ways to run this service:

### Interactive Mode

This is the default mode, giving you a nice terminal interface to control the service:

```bash
./vision-service
```

You'll see a menu with these options:
- Press 's' to start the service
- Press 'q' to stop the service
- Press 'x' to exit

### Headless Mode

For production or when you want to run it without the interactive interface:

```bash
./vision-service --headless
```

## Configuration

The service is configurable through environment variables:

- `PORT`: Service port (default: 8080)
- `DD_AGENT_URL`: Datadog Agent URL (default: 127.0.0.1:8125)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: info)

## Health Check

Once the service is running, you can check its health at:

```
http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Observability

We've baked in some serious observability features:

- Structured logging with Logrus
- Metrics collection with Datadog
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring

## Development Workflow

Here's my typical workflow when working on this service:

1. Make changes to the code
2. Run tests (when we add them)
3. Build the service: `go build -o vision-service`
4. Test in interactive mode: `./vision-service`
5. Deploy to test environment in headless mode: `./vision-service --headless`

## Next Steps

Looking to extend this base? Here are some ideas:

1. Add computer vision integration (OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.)
2. Implement Windows service installation
3. Add more metrics and logging
4. Create a proper CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

1. Check the logs - they're in JSON format for easy parsing
2. Verify the Datadog Agent is running
3. Make sure no other service is using port 8080
4. Check your environment variables

## Wrapping Up

That's it! You've now got a solid foundation for a computer vision service with enterprise-grade observability. The service is ready to be extended with actual computer vision capabilities while maintaining good operational practices.
